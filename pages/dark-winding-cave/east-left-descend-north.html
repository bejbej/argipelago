                The passage opens up to a large cavernous room.
                A small nook in the wall reveals an abandoned camp and scattered remains â€”
                the legacy of another explorer lost in this winding labyrinth.
                All that remaines of the hapless soul is a broken skeleton and scraps of clothing.
                Hardly a reward given the effort.
